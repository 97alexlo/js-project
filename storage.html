    <h1>Window.localStorage</h1>
    <p>localStorage is one of the two mechanisms of the Web Storage API. It allows JavaScript websites to save key-value pairs (both as strings) in a browser without an expiration date, even after the page is closed. In google chrome and firefox, localStorage is stored in an SQLite file in the user's profile folder. </p>
